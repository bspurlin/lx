Extracted from [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) for general use.\n\nIn addition to negotatior, it allows:\n\n- Allows types as an array or arguments list, ie `(['text/html', 'application/json'])` as well as `('text/html', 'application/json')`.\n- Allows type shorthands such as `json`.\n- Returns `false` when no types match\n- Treats non-existent headers as `*`\n\n## API\n\n### var accept = new Accepts(req)\n\n```js\nvar accepts = require('accepts')\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  var accept = accepts(req)\n})\n```\n\n### accept\\[property\\]\\(\\)\n\nReturns all the explicitly accepted content property as an array in descending priority.\n\n- `accept.types()`\n- `accept.encodings()`\n- `accept.charsets()`\n- `accept.languages()`\n\nThey are also aliased in singular form such as `accept.type()`. `accept.languages()` is also aliased as `accept.langs()`, etc.\n\nNote: you should almost never do this in a real app as it defeats the purpose of content negotiation.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n// in Google Chrome\nvar encodings = accept.encodings() // -> ['sdch', 'gzip', 'deflate']\n```\n\nSince you probably don't support `sdch`, you should just supply the encodings you support:\n\n```js\nvar encoding = accept.encodings('gzip', 'deflate') // -> 'gzip', probably\n```\n\n### accept\\[property\\]\\(values, ...\\)\n\nYou can either have `values` be an array or have an argument list of values.\n\nIf the client does not accept any `values`, `false` will be returned.\nIf the client accepts any `values`, the preferred `value` will be return.\n\nFor `accept.types()`, shorthand mime types are allowed.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n// req.headers.accept = 'application/json'\n\naccept.types('json') // -> 'json'\naccept.types('html', 'json') // -> 'json'\naccept.types('html') // -> false\n\n// req.headers.accept = ''\n// which is equivalent to `*`\n\naccept.types() // -> [], no explicit types\naccept.types('text/html', 'text/json') // -> 'text/html', since it was first\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.\n\nExample _app.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n\n// fake app\n\ndebug('booting %s', name);\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n\n// fake worker of some kind\n\nrequire('./worker');\n```\n\nExample _worker.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('worker');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Millisecond diff\n\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n\n  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Conventions\n\n If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\".\n\n## Wildcards\n\n  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with \"connect:\".\n\n## Browser support\n\n  Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`.\n\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  b('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\n\n#### Web Inspector Colors\n\n  Colors are also enabled on \"Web Inspectors\" that understand the `%c` formatting\n  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, and the Firebug plugin for Firefox.\n  Colored output looks something like:\n\n  ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)\n\n### stderr vs stdout\n\nYou can set an alternative logging method per-namespace by overriding the `log` method on a per-namespace or globally:\n\nExample _stderr.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('../');\nvar log = debug('app:log');\n\n// by default console.log is used\nlog('goes to stdout!');\n\nvar error = debug('app:error');\n// set this namespace to log via console.error\nerror.log = console.error.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console!\nerror('goes to stderr');\nlog('still goes to stdout!');\n\n// set all output to go via console.warn\n// overrides all per-namespace log settings\ndebug.log = console.warn.bind(console);\nlog('now goes to stderr via console.warn');\nerror('still goes to stderr, but via console.warn now');\n```\n\n## Authors\n\n - TJ Holowaychuk\n - Nathan Rajlich\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/visionmedia/debug.git","homepage":"https://github.com/visionmedia/debug","license":"MIT"},{"name":"depd","label":"depd@0.3.0","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/express/node_modules/depd/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright (c) 2014 Douglas Christopher Wilson","text":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Douglas Christopher Wilson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"license":"MIT","repository":"git://github.com/dougwilson/nodejs-depd","homepage":"https://github.com/dougwilson/nodejs-depd"},{"name":"finalhandler","label":"finalhandler@0.0.2","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/express/node_modules/finalhandler/README.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2014 Douglas Christopher Wilson","text":"# finalhandler\n\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/finalhandler.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/finalhandler)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/finalhandler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/finalhandler)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/expressjs/finalhandler.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/expressjs/finalhandler)\n\nNode.js function to invoke as the final step to respond to HTTP request.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n$ npm install finalhandler\n```\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar finalhandler = require('finalhandler')\n```\n\n### finalhandler(req, res, [options])\n\nReturns function to be invoked as the final step for the given `req` and `res`.\nThis function is to be invoked as `fn(err)`.

Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/visionmedia/send.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/visionmedia/send)\n\n  Send is Connect's `static()` extracted for generalized use, a streaming static file\n  server supporting partial responses (Ranges), conditional-GET negotiation, high test coverage, and granular events which may be leveraged to take appropriate actions in your application or framework.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install send\n\n## Examples\n\n  Small:\n\n```js\nvar http = require('http');\nvar send = require('send');\n\nvar app = http.createServer(function(req, res){\n  send(req, req.url).pipe(res);\n}).listen(3000);\n```\n\n  Serving from a root directory with custom error-handling:\n\n```js\nvar http = require('http');\nvar send = require('send');\nvar url = require('url');\n\nvar app = http.createServer(function(req, res){\n  // your custom error-handling logic:\n  function error(err) {\n    res.statusCode = err.status || 500;\n    res.end(err.message);\n  }\n\n  // your custom headers\n  function headers(res, path, stat) {\n    // serve all files for download\n    res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'attachment');\n  }\n\n  // your custom directory handling logic:\n  function redirect() {\n    res.statusCode = 301;\n    res.setHeader('Location', req.url + '/');\n    res.end('Redirecting to ' + req.url + '/');\n  }\n\n  // transfer arbitrary files from within\n  // /www/example.com/public/*\n  send(req, url.parse(req.url).pathname, {root: '/www/example.com/public'})\n  .on('error', error)\n  .on('directory', redirect)\n  .on('headers', headers)\n  .pipe(res);\n}).listen(3000);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Options\n\n#### etag\n\n  Enable or disable etag generation, defaults to true.\n\n#### hidden\n\n  Enable or disable transfer of hidden files, defaults to false.\n\n#### index\n\n  By default send supports \"index.html\" files, to disable this\n  set `false` or to supply a new index pass a string or an array\n  in preferred order.\n\n#### maxage\n\n  Provide a max-age in milliseconds for http caching, defaults to 0.\n  This can also be a string accepted by the\n  [ms](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ms#readme) module.\n\n#### root\n\n  Serve files relative to `path`.\n\n### Events\n\n  - `error` an error occurred `(err)`\n  - `directory` a directory was requested\n  - `file` a file was requested `(path, stat)`\n  - `headers` the headers are about to be set on a file `(res, path, stat)`\n  - `stream` file streaming has started `(stream)`\n  - `end` streaming has completed\n\n### .etag(bool)\n\n  Enable or disable etag generation, defaults to true.\n\n### .root(dir)\n\n  Serve files relative to `path`. Aliased as `.from(dir)`.\n\n### .index(paths)\n\n  By default send supports \"index.html\" files, to disable this\n  invoke `.index(false)` or to supply a new index pass a string\n  or an array in preferred order.\n\n### .maxage(ms)\n\n  Provide a max-age in milliseconds for http caching, defaults to 0.\n  This can also be a string accepted by the\n  [ms](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ms#readme) module.\n\n### .hidden(bool)\n\n  Enable or disable transfer of hidden files, defaults to false.\n\n## Error-handling\n\n  By default when no `error` listeners are present an automatic response will be made, otherwise you have full control over the response, aka you may show a 5xx page etc.\n\n## Caching\n\n  It does _not_ perform internal caching, you should use a reverse proxy cache such\n  as Varnish for this, or those fancy things called CDNs. If your application is small enough that it would benefit from single-node memory caching, it's small enough that it does not need caching at all ;).\n\n## Debugging\n\n To enable `debug()` instrumentation output export __DEBUG__:\n\n```\n$ DEBUG=send node app\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\n```\n$ npm install\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"license":"MIT","repository":"git://github.com/visionmedia/send","homepage":"https://github.com/visionmedia/send"},{"name":"finished","label":"finished@1.2.2","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/express/node_modules/send/node_modules/finished/README.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com","text":"# finished\n\n[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/finished.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/finished)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/finished.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/finished)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/expressjs/finished.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/expressjs/finished)\n\nExecute a callback when a request closes, finishes, or errors.\n\n#### Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install finished\n```\n\n#### Uses\n\nThis is useful for cleaning up streams.

In case you omit the options object, the file will be renamed and uploaded to the temporary directory of the system.\n\nBy the default, Multer will rename the files so as to avoid name conflicts. The renaming function can be customized according to your needs.\n\nThe following are the options that can be passed to Multer.\n\n* `dest`\n* `limits`\n* `rename(fieldname, filename)`\n* `onFileUploadStart(file)`\n* `onFileUploadData(file, data)`\n* `onFileUploadComplete(file)`\n* `onParseStart()`\n* `onParseEnd()`\n* `onError()`\n* `onFilesLimit()`\n* `onFieldsLimit()`\n* `onPartsLimit()`\n\nApart from these, Multer also supports more advanced [busboy options](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#busboy-methods) like `highWaterMark`, `fileHwm`, and `defCharset`.\n\nIn an average web app, only `dest` and `rename` might be required, and configured as shown in the example.\n\n```js\napp.use(multer({\n  dest: './uploads/',\n  rename: function (fieldname, filename) {\n    return filename.replace(/\\W+/g, '-').toLowerCase() + Date.now()\n  }\n}))\n```\n\nThe details of the properties of the options object is explained in the following sections.\n\n### dest\n\nThe destination directory for the uploaded files.\n\n`dest: './uploads/'`\n\n### limits\n\nAn object specifying the size limits of the following optional properties.\n\n* `fieldNameSize` - integer - Max field name size (Default: 100 bytes)\n* `fieldSize` - integer - Max field value size (Default: 1MB)\n* `fields` - integer - Max number of non-file fields (Default: Infinity)\n* `fileSize` - integer - For multipart forms, the max file size (Default: Infinity)\n* `files` - integer - For multipart forms, the max number of file fields (Default: Infinity)\n* `parts` - integer - For multipart forms, the max number of parts (fields + files) (Default: Infinity)\n* `headerPairs` - integer - For multipart forms, the max number of header key=>value pairs to parse Default: 2000 (same as node's http).\n\n```js\nlimits: {\n  fieldNameSize: 100,\n  files: 2,\n  fields: 5\n}\n```\n\nSpecifying the limits can help protect your site against denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n\n### rename(fieldname, filename)\n\nFunction to rename the uploaded files. Whatever the function returns will become the new name of the uploaded file (extension is not included). The `fieldname` and `filename` of the file will be available in this function, use them if you need to.\n\n```js\nrename: function (fieldname, filename) {\n  return fieldname + filename + Date.now()\n}\n```\n\n### onFileUploadStart(file)\n\nEvent handler triggered when a file starts to be uploaded. A file object with the following properties are available to this function: `fieldname`, `originalname`, `name`, `encoding`, `mimetype`, `path`, `extension`.\n\n```js\nonFileUploadStart: function (file) {\n  console.log(file.fieldname + ' is starting ...')\n}\n```\n\n### onFileUploadData(file, data)\n\nEvent handler triggered when a chunk of buffer is received. A buffer object along with a file object is available to the function.\n\n```js\nonFileUploadData: function (file, data) {\n  console.log(data.length + ' of ' + file.fieldname + ' arrived')\n}\n```\n\n### onFileUploadComplete(file)\n\nEvent handler trigger when a file is completely uploaded. A file object is available to the function.\n\n```js\nonFileUploadComplete: function (file) {\n  console.log(file.fieldname + ' uploaded to  ' + file.path)\n}\n```\n\n### onParseStart()\n\nEvent handler triggered when the form parsing starts.\n\n```js\nonParseStart: function () {\n  console.log('Form parsing started at: ', new Date())\n}\n```\n\n### onParseEnd()\n\nEvent handler triggered when the form parsing completes.\n\n```js\nonParseStart: function () {\n  console.log('Form parsing completed at: ', new Date())\n}\n```\n\n### onError()\n\nEvent handler for any errors encountering while processing the form. The `error` object and the `next` object is available to the function. If you are handling errors yourself, make sure to terminate the request or call the `next()` function, else the request will be left hanging.\n\n```js\nonError: function (error, next) {\n  console.log(error)\n  next(error)\n}\n```\n\n### onFilesLimit()\n\nEvent handler triggered when the number of files exceed the specification in the `limit` object. No more files will be parsed after the limit is reached.\n\n```js\nonFilesLimit: function () {\n  console.log('Crossed file limit!')\n}\n```\n\n### onFieldsLimit()\n\nEvent handler triggered when the number of fields exceed the specification in the `limit` object. No more fields will be parsed after the limit is reached.\n\n```js\nonFilesLimit: function () {\n  console.log('Crossed fields limit!')\n}\n```\n\n### onPartsLimit()\n\nEvent handler triggered when the number of parts exceed the specification in the `limit` object. No more files or fields will be parsed after the limit is reached.\n\n```js\nonFilesLimit: function () {\n  console.log('Crossed parts limit!')\n}\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Hage Yaapa <[http://www.hacksparrow.com](http://www.hacksparrow.com)>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.\n \nExample _app.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n\n// fake app\n\ndebug('booting %s', name);\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n\n// fake worker of some kind\n\nrequire('./worker');\n```\n\nExample _worker.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('worker');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Millisecond diff\n\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n\n  When stderr is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n  _(NOTE: Debug now uses stderr instead of stdout, so the correct shell command for this example is actually `DEBUG=* node example/worker 2> out &`)_\n  \n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n  \n## Conventions\n\n If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\". \n\n## Wildcards\n\n  The \"*\" character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.  For example, `DEBUG=* -connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with \"connect:\".\n\n## Browser support\n\n Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`. \n\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/visionmedia/debug.git","homepage":"https://github.com/visionmedia/debug","license":"MIT"},{"name":"engine.io","label":"engine.io@1.3.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/README.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2014 Guillermo Rauch <guillermo@learnboost.com>","text":"\n# Engine.IO: the realtime engine\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io)\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io)\n\n`Engine.IO` is the implementation of transport-based\ncross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for\n[Socket.IO](http://github.com/learnboost/socket.io).\n\n## How to use\n\n### Server\n\n#### (A) Listening on a port\n\n```js\nvar engine = require('engine.io');\nvar server = engine.listen(80);\n\nserver.on('connection', function(socket){\n  socket.send('utf 8 string');\n  socket.send(new Buffer([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // binary data\n});\n```\n\n#### (B) Intercepting requests for a http.Server\n\n```js\nvar engine = require('engine.io');\nvar http = require('http').createServer().listen(3000);\nvar server = engine.attach(http);\n\nserver.on('connection', function (socket) {\n  socket.on('message', function(data){ });\n  socket.on('close', function(){ });\n});\n```\n\n#### (C) Passing in requests\n\n```js\nvar engine = require('engine.io');\nvar server = new engine.Server();\n\nserver.on('connection', function(socket){\n  socket.send('hi');\n});\n\n// …\nhttpServer.on('upgrade', function(req, socket, head){\n  server.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head);\n});\nhttpServer.on('request', function(req, res){\n  server.handleRequest(req, res);\n});\n```\n\n### Client\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/engine.io.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  var socket = new eio.Socket('ws://localhost/');\n  socket.on('open', function(){\n    socket.on('message', function(data){});\n    socket.on('close', function(){});\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nFor more information on the client refer to the\n[engine-client](http://github.com/learnboost/engine.io-client) repository.\n\n## What features does it have?\n\n- **Maximum reliability**. Connections are established even in the presence of:\n  - proxies and load balancers.\n  - personal firewall and antivirus software.\n  - for more information refer to **Goals** and **Architecture** sections\n- **Minimal client size** aided by:\n  - lazy loading of flash transports.\n  - lack of redundant transports.\n- **Scalable**\n  - load balancer friendly\n- **Future proof**\n- **100% Node.JS core style**\n  - No API sugar (left for higher level projects)\n  - Written in readable vanilla JavaScript\n\n## API\n\n### Server\n\n<hr><br>\n\n#### Top-level\n\nThese are exposed by `require('engine.io')`:\n\n##### Events\n\n- `flush`\n    - Called when a socket buffer is being flushed.\n    - **Arguments**\n      - `Socket`: socket being flushed\n      - `Array`: write buffer\n- `drain`\n    - Called when a socket buffer is drained\n    - **Arguments**\n      - `Socket`: socket being flushed\n\n##### Properties\n\n- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number\n- `Server`: Server class constructor\n- `Socket`: Socket class constructor\n- `Transport` _(Function)_: transport constructor\n- `transports` _(Object)_: map of available transports\n\n##### Methods\n\n- `()`\n    - Returns a new `Server` instance. If the first argument is an `http.Server` then the\n      new `Server` instance will be attached to it. Otherwise, the arguments are passed\n      directly to the `Server` constructor.\n    - **Parameters**\n      - `http.Server`: optional, server to attach to.\n      - `Object`: optional, options object (see `Server#constructor` api docs below)\n\n  The following are identical ways to instantiate a server and then attach it.\n  ```js\n  var httpServer; // previously created with `http.createServer();` from node.js api.\n\n  // create a server first, and then attach\n  var eioServer = require('engine.io').Server();\n  eioServer.attach(httpServer);\n\n  // or call the module as a function to get `Server`\n  var eioServer = require('engine.io')();\n  eioServer.attach(httpServer);\n\n  // immediately attach\n  var eioServer = require('engine.io')(http_server);\n  ```\n\n- `listen`\n    - Creates an `http.Server` which listens on the given port and attaches WS\n      to it.

Also any ArrayBufferView can be sent as is.\n      - `Function`: optional, a callback executed when the message gets flushed out by the transport\n    - **Returns** `Socket` for chaining\n- `close`\n    - Disconnects the client\n    - **Returns** `Socket` for chaining\n\n### Client\n\n<hr><br>\n\nExposed in the `eio` global namespace (in the browser), or by\n`require('engine.io-client')` (in Node.JS).\n\nFor the client API refer to the \n[engine-client](http://github.com/learnboost/engine.io-client) repository.\n\n## Debug / logging\n\nEngine.IO is powered by [debug](http://github.com/visionmedia/debug).\nIn order to see all the debug output, run your app with the environment variable\n`DEBUG` including the desired scope.\n\nTo see the output from all of Engine.IO's debugging scopes you can use:\n\n```\nDEBUG=engine* node myapp\n```\n\n## Transports\n\n- `polling`: XHR / JSONP polling transport.\n- `websocket`: WebSocket transport.\n\n## Plugins\n\n- [engine.io-conflation](https://github.com/EugenDueck/engine.io-conflation): Makes **conflation and aggregation** of messages straightforward.\n\n## Support\n\nThe support channels for `engine.io` are the same as `socket.io`:\n  - irc.freenode.net **#socket.io**\n  - [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/socket_io)\n  - [Website](http://socket.io)\n\n## Development\n\nTo contribute patches, run tests or benchmarks, make sure to clone the\nrepository:\n\n```\ngit clone git://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io.git\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```\ncd engine.io\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nTests run with `make test`. It runs the server tests that are aided by\nthe usage of `engine.io-client`.\n\nMake sure `npm install` is run first.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe main goal of `Engine` is ensuring the most reliable realtime communication.\nUnlike the previous Socket.IO core, it always establishes a long-polling\nconnection first, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are \"tested\" on\nthe side.\n\nDuring the lifetime of the Socket.IO projects, we've found countless drawbacks\nto relying on `HTML5 WebSocket` or `Flash Socket` as the first connection\nmechanisms.\n\nBoth are clearly the _right way_ of establishing a bidirectional communication,\nwith HTML5 WebSocket being the way of the future. However, to answer most business\nneeds, alternative traditional HTTP 1.1 mechanisms are just as good as delivering\nthe same solution.\n\nWebSocket based connections have two fundamental benefits:\n\n1. **Better server performance**\n\n  - _A: Load balancers_<br>\n      Load balancing a long polling connection poses a serious architectural nightmare\n      since requests can come from any number of open sockets by the user agent, but\n      they all need to be routed to the process and computer that owns the `Engine`\n      connection. This negatively impacts RAM and CPU usage.\n  - _B: Network traffic_<br>\n      WebSocket is designed around the premise that each message frame has to be \n      surrounded by the least amount of data. In HTTP 1.1 transports, each message\n      frame is surrounded by HTTP headers and chunked encoding frames. If you try to\n      send the message _\"Hello world\"_ with xhr-polling, the message ultimately\n      becomes larger than if you were to send it with WebSocket.\n  - _C: Lightweight parser_<br>\n      As an effect of **B**, the server has to do a lot more work to parse the network\n      data and figure out the message when traditional HTTP requests are used\n      (as in long polling). This means that another advantage of WebSocket is\n      less server CPU usage.\n\n2. **Better user experience**\n\n    Due to the reasons stated in point **1**, the most important effect of being able\n    to establish a WebSocket connection is raw data transfer speed, which translates\n    in _some_ cases in better user experience.\n\n    Applications with heavy realtime interaction (such as games) will benefit greatly,\n    whereas applications like realtime chat (Gmail/Facebook), newsfeeds (Facebook) or\n    timelines (Twitter) will have negligible user experience improvements.\n\nHaving said this, attempting to establish a WebSocket connection directly so far has\nproven problematic:\n\n1. **Proxies**<br>\n    Many corporate proxies block WebSocket traffic.\n\n2. **Personal firewall and antivirus software**<br>\n    As a result of our research, we've found that at least 3 personal security\n    applications block WebSocket traffic.\n\n3. **Cloud application platforms**<br>\n    Platforms like Heroku or No.de have had trouble keeping up with the fast-paced\n    nature of the evolution of the WebSocket protocol. Applications therefore end up\n    inevitably using long polling, but the seamless installation experience of \n    Socket.IO we strive for (_\"require() it and it just works\"_) disappears.\n\nSome of these problems have solutions. In the case of proxies and personal programs,\nhowever, the solutions many times involve upgrading software. Experience has shown\nthat relying on client software upgrades to deliver a business solution is\nfruitless: the very existence of this project has to do with a fragmented panorama\nof user agent distribution, with clients connecting with latest versions of the most\nmodern user agents (Chrome, Firefox and Safari), but others with versions as low as\nIE 5.5.\n\nFrom the user perspective, an unsuccessful WebSocket connection can translate in\nup to at least 10 seconds of waiting for the realtime application to begin\nexchanging data. This **perceptively** hurts user experience.\n\nTo summarize, **Engine** focuses on reliability and user experience first, marginal\npotential UX improvements and increased server performance second. `Engine` is the\nresult of all the lessons learned with WebSocket in the wild.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe main premise of `Engine`, and the core of its existence, is the ability to\nswap transports on the fly. A connection starts as xhr-polling, but it can\nswitch to WebSocket.\n\nThe central problem this poses is: how do we switch transports without losing\nmessages?\n\n`Engine` only switches from polling to another transport in between polling\ncycles. Since the server closes the connection after a certain timeout when\nthere's no activity, and the polling transport implementation buffers messages\nin between connections, this ensures no message loss and optimal performance.\n\nAnother benefit of this design is that we workaround almost all the limitations\nof **Flash Socket**, such as slow connection times, increased file size (we can\nsafely lazy load it without hurting user experience), etc.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can I use engine without Socket.IO ?\n\nAbsolutely. Although the recommended framework for building realtime applications\nis Socket.IO, since it provides fundamental features for real-world applications \nsuch as multiplexing, reconnection support, etc.\n\n`Engine` is to Socket.IO what Connect is to Express. An essential piece for building\nrealtime frameworks, but something you _probably_ won't be using for building\nactual applications.\n\n### Does the server serve the client?\n\nNo. The main reason is that `Engine` is meant to be bundled with frameworks.\nSocket.IO includes `Engine`, therefore serving two clients is not necessary. If\nyou use Socket.IO, including\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\">\n```\n\nhas you covered.\n\n### Can I implement `Engine` in other languages?\n\nAbsolutely. The [engine.io-protocol](https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol)\nrepository contains the most up to date description of the specification\nat all times, and the parser implementation in JavaScript.\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Guillermo Rauch <guillermo@learnboost.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n"}],"repository":"git@github.com:LearnBoost/engine.io.git","homepage":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io","license":"MIT"},{"name":"debug","label":"debug@0.6.0","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/debug/Readme.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>","text":"\n# debug\n\n  tiny node.js debugging utility.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install debug\n```\n\n## Example\n\n  This module is modelled after node core's debugging technique, allowing you to enable one or more topic-specific debugging functions, for example core does the following within many modules:\n\n```js\nvar debug;\nif (process.env.NODE_DEBUG && /cluster/.test(process.env.NODE_DEBUG)) {\n  debug = function(x) {\n    var prefix = process.pid + ',' +\n        (process.env.NODE_WORKER_ID ? 'Worker' : 'Master');\n    console.error(prefix, x);\n  };\n} else {\n  debug = function() { };\n}\n```\n\n This concept is extremely simple but it works well. With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.\n \nExample _app.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n\n// fake app\n\ndebug('booting %s', name);\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n\n// fake worker of some kind\n\nrequire('./worker');\n```\n\nExample _worker.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('worker');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Millisecond diff\n\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n\n  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n  \n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Conventions\n\n If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\". \n\n## Wildcards\n\n  The \"*\" character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.  For example, `DEBUG=* -connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with \"connect:\".\n\n## Browser support\n\n Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`. \n\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."}],"license":"MIT"},{"name":"engine.io-parser","label":"engine.io-parser@1.0.6","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/engine.io-parser/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright (c) 2014 Automattic <dev@cloudup.com>","text":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Automattic <dev@cloudup.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."}],"repository":"git@github.com:LearnBoost/engine.io-parser.git","homepage":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol","license":"MIT"},{"name":"after","label":"after@0.8.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/engine.io-parser/node_modules/after/LICENCE","notice":"Copyright (c) 2011 Raynos.","text":"Copyright (c) 2011 Raynos.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n"},{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/engine.io-parser/node_modules/utf8/LICENSE-MIT.txt","notice":"Copyright Mathias Bynens <http://mathiasbynens.be/>","text":"Copyright Mathias Bynens <http://mathiasbynens.be/>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

See http://einaros.github.com/ws for the full reports.\n\nComes with a command line utility, `wscat`, which can either act as a server (--listen), or client (--connect); Use it to debug simple websocket services.\n\n## Protocol support ##\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera. Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`, or argument `-p 8` for wscat)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`, or argument `-p 13` for wscat)\n\n_See the echo.websocket.org example below for how to use the `protocolVersion` option._\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### Installing ###\n\n`npm install ws`\n\n### Sending and receiving text data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\nws.on('open', function() {\n    ws.send('something');\n});\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n    // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received\n    // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\nws.on('open', function() {\n    var array = new Float32Array(5);\n    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) array[i] = i / 2;\n    ws.send(array, {binary: true, mask: true});\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be masked according to the websocket protocol. The same option applies for text data.\n\n### Server example ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\nwss.on('connection', function(ws) {\n    ws.on('message', function(message) {\n        console.log('received: %s', message);\n    });\n    ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\n  \nwss.broadcast = function(data) {\n\tfor(var i in this.clients)\n\t\tthis.clients[i].send(data);\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices ###\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional callback.\n// The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function(error) {\n    // if error is null, the send has been completed,\n    // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note**\n// that since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not*\n// be captured when this technique is used.\ntry {\n    ws.send('something');\n}\ncatch (e) {\n    // handle error\n}\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {protocolVersion: 8, origin: 'http://websocket.org'});\nws.on('open', function() {\n    console.log('connected');\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\nws.on('close', function() {\n    console.log('disconnected');\n});\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n    console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n    }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### wscat against echo.websocket.org ###\n\n    $ npm install -g ws\n    $ wscat -c ws://echo.websocket.org -p 8\n    connected (press CTRL+C to quit)\n    > hi there\n    < hi there\n    > are you a happy parrot?\n    < are you a happy parrot?\n\n### Other examples ###\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the examples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express 2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests ###\n\n`make test`\n\n## API Docs ##\n\nSee the doc/ directory for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## License ##\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik <einaros@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/einaros/ws.git","homepage":"https://github.com/einaros/ws","license":"MIT"},{"name":"commander","label":"commander@0.6.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/ws/node_modules/commander/Readme.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>","text":"# Commander.js\n\n  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).\n\n [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install commander\n\n## Option parsing\n\n Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('commander');\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')\n  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')\n  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')\n  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('you ordered a pizza with:');\nif (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');\nif (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineappe');\nif (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');\nconsole.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);\n```\n\n Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as \"--template-engine\" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.\n\n## Automated --help\n\n The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:\n\n```  \n $ ./examples/pizza --help\n\n   Usage: pizza [options]\n\n   Options:\n\n     -V, --version        output the version number\n     -p, --peppers        Add peppers\n     -P, --pineapple      Add pineappe\n     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce\n     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\n     -h, --help           output usage information\n\n```\n\n## Coercion\n\n```js\nfunction range(val) {\n  return val.split('..').map(Number);\n}\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',');\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .usage('[options] <file ...>')\n  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)\n  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)\n  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)\n  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)\n  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(' int: %j', program.integer);\nconsole.log(' float: %j', program.float);\nconsole.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);\nprogram.range = program.range || [];\nconsole.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);\nconsole.log(' list: %j', program.list);\nconsole.log(' args: %j', program.args);\n```\n\n## Custom help\n\n You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information\n by listening for \"--help\". Commander will automatically\n exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program\n does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example\n in the following executable \"stuff\" will not output when\n `--help` is used.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('../');\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',').map(Number);\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')\n  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')\n  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');\n\n// must be before .parse() since\n// node's emit() is immediate\n\nprogram.on('--help', function(){\n  console.log('  Examples:');\n  console.log('');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');\n  console.log('');\n});\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('stuff');\n```\n\nyielding the following help output:\n\n```\n\nUsage: custom-help [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -V, --version  output the version number\n  -f, --foo      enable some foo\n  -b, --bar      enable some bar\n  -B, --baz      enable some baz\n\nExamples:\n\n  $ custom-help --help\n  $ custom-help -h\n\n```\n\n## .prompt(msg, fn)\n\n Single-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('name: ', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Multi-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('description:', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Coercion:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Age: ', Number, function(age){\n  console.log('age: %j', age);\n});\n```\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Birthdate: ', Date, function(date){\n  console.log('date: %s', date);\n});\n```\n\n## .password(msg[, mask], fn)\n\nPrompt for password without echoing:\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nPrompt for password with mask char \"*\":\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', '*', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\n## .confirm(msg, fn)\n\n Confirm with the given `msg`:\n\n```js\nprogram.confirm('continue?

Otherwise\n    binary is encoded into base64 strings, and decoded when binary types are\n    supported.\n  - With browsers that don't support ArrayBuffer, an object { base64: true,\n    data: dataAsBase64String } is emitted on the `message` event.\n\n## API\n\n### Socket\n\nThe client class. Mixes in [Emitter](http://github.com/component/emitter).\nExposed as `eio` in the browser standalone build.\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number\n- `binaryType` _(String)_ : can be set to 'arraybuffer' or 'blob' in browsers,\n  and `buffer` or `arraybuffer` in Node. Blob is only used in browser if it's\n  supported.\n\n#### Events\n\n- `open`\n  - Fired upon successful connection.\n- `message`\n  - Fired when data is received from the server.\n  - **Arguments**\n    - `String` | `ArrayBuffer`: utf-8 encoded data or ArrayBuffer containing\n      binary data\n- `close`\n  - Fired upon disconnection. In compliance with the WebSocket API spec, this event may be \n    fired even if the `open` event does not occur (i.e. due to connection error or `close()`).\n- `error`\n  - Fired when an error occurs.\n- `flush`\n  - Fired upon completing a buffer flush\n- `drain`\n  - Fired after `drain` event of transport if writeBuffer is empty\n- `upgradeError`\n  - Fired if an error occurs with a transport we're trying to upgrade to.\n- `upgrade`\n  - Fired upon upgrade success, after the new transport is set\n\n#### Methods\n\n- **constructor**\n    - Initializes the client\n    - **Parameters**\n      - `String` uri\n      - `Object`: optional, options object\n    - **Options**\n      - `agent` (`http.Agent`): `http.Agent` to use, defaults to `false` (NodeJS only)\n      - `upgrade` (`Boolean`): defaults to true, whether the client should try\n      to upgrade the transport from long-polling to something better.\n      - `forceJSONP` (`Boolean`): forces JSONP for polling transport.\n      - `forceBase64` (`Boolean`): forces base 64 encoding for polling transport even when XHR2 responseType is available and WebSocket even if the used standard supports binary.\n      - `timestampRequests` (`Boolean`): whether to add the timestamp with\n        each transport request. Note: this is ignored if the browser is\n        IE or Android, in which case requests are always stamped (`false`)\n      - `timestampParam` (`String`): timestamp parameter (`t`)\n      - `policyPort` (`Number`): port the policy server listens on (`843`)\n      - `path` (`String`): path to connect to, default is `/engine.io`\n      - `transports` (`Array`): a list of transports to try (in order).\n      Defaults to `['polling', 'websocket']`. `Engine`\n      always attempts to connect directly with the first one, provided the\n      feature detection test for it passes.\n      - `rememberUpgrade` (`Boolean`): defaults to false.\n        If true and if the previous websocket connection to the server succeeded,\n        the connection attempt will bypass the normal upgrade process and will initially\n        try websocket. A connection attempt following a transport error will use the \n        normal upgrade process. It is recommended you turn this on only when using\n        SSL/TLS connections, or if you know that your network does not block websockets.\n- `send`\n    - Sends a message to the server\n    - **Parameters**\n      - `String` | `ArrayBuffer` | `ArrayBufferView` | `Blob`: data to send\n      - `Function`: optional, callback upon `drain`\n- `close`\n    - Disconnects the client.\n\n### Transport\n\nThe transport class. Private. _Inherits from EventEmitter_.\n\n#### Events\n\n- `poll`: emitted by polling transports upon starting a new request\n- `pollComplete`: emitted by polling transports upon completing a request\n- `drain`: emitted by polling transports upon a buffer drain\n\n## Tests\n\n`engine.io-client` is used to test\n[engine](http://github.com/automattic/engine.io). Running the `engine.io`\ntest suite ensures the client works and vice-versa.\n\nBrowser tests are run using [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul). You can\nrun the tests locally using the following command.\n\n```\n./node_modules/.bin/zuul --local 8080 -- test/index.js\n```\n\nAdditionally, `engine.io-client` has a standalone test suite you can run\nwith `make test` which will run node.js and browser tests. You must have zuul setup with\na saucelabs account.\n\n## Support\n\nThe support channels for `engine.io-client` are the same as `socket.io`:\n  - irc.freenode.net **#socket.io**\n  - [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/socket_io)\n  - [Website](http://socket.io)\n\n## Development\n\nTo contribute patches, run tests or benchmarks, make sure to clone the\nrepository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/automattic/engine.io-client.git\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ncd engine.io-client\nnpm install\n```\n\nSee the `Tests` section above for how to run tests before submitting any patches.\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Copyright (c) 2014 Automattic, Inc.\n\n"}],"repository":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-client.git","homepage":"http://socket.io"},{"name":"parsejson","label":"parsejson@0.0.1","licensefile":[{}],"license":"MIT"},{"name":"better-assert","label":"better-assert@1.0.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/socket.io-client/node_modules/engine.io-client/node_modules/parsejson/node_modules/better-assert/Readme.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2012 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>","text":"\n# better-assert\n\n  Better c-style assertions using [callsite](https://github.com/visionmedia/callsite) for\n  self-documenting failure messages.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install better-assert\n\n## Example\n\n By default assertions are enabled, however the __NO_ASSERT__ environment variable \n will deactivate them when truthy.\n\n```js\nvar assert = require('better-assert');\n\ntest();\n\nfunction test() {\n  var user = { name: 'tobi' };\n  assert('tobi' == user.name);\n  assert('number' == typeof user.age);\n}\n\nAssertionError: 'number' == typeof user.age\n    at test (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:9:3)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:4:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\n    at Module.runMain (module.js:492:10)\n    at process.startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."}],"repository":"https://github.com/visionmedia/better-assert.git","homepage":"https://github.com/visionmedia/better-assert","license":"MIT"},{"name":"callsite","label":"callsite@1.0.0","licensefile":[{}],"license":"undefined"},{"name":"parseqs","label":"parseqs@0.0.2","licensefile":[{}],"license":"MIT"},{"name":"xmlhttprequest","label":"xmlhttprequest@1.5.0","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/parker/Desktop/Link to Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/socket.io-client/node_modules/engine.io-client/node_modules/xmlhttprequest/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright (c) 2010 passive.ly LLC","text":" Copyright (c) 2010 passive.ly LLC\n\n Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\n obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\n files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\n restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\n copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\n Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following\n conditions:\n\n The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\n included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\n OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\n NONINFRINGEMENT.

Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, 'options');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, 'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Alternatively you can\nserve the file `socket.io.js` found at the root of this repository.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  var socket = io('http://localhost');\n  socket.on('connect', function(){\n    socket.on('event', function(data){});\n    socket.on('disconnect', function(){});\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nSocket.IO is compatible with [browserify](http://browserify.org/).\n\n### Node.JS (server-side usage)\n\n  Add `socket.io-client` to your `package.json` and then:\n\n  ```js\n  var socket = require('socket.io-client')('http://localhost');\n  socket.on('connect', function(){\n    socket.on('event', function(data){});\n    socket.on('disconnect', function(){});\n  });\n  ```\n\n## API\n\n### IO(url:String, opts:Object):Socket\n\n  Exposed as the `io` namespace in the standalone build, or the result\n  of calling `require('socket.io-client')`.\n\n  When called, it creates a new `Manager` for the given URL, and attempts\n  to reuse an existing `Manager` for subsequent calls, unless the\n  `multiplex` option is passed with `false`.\n\n  The rest of the options are passed to the `Manager` constructor (see below\n  for details).\n\n  A `Socket` instance is returned for the namespace specified by the\n  pathname in the URL, defaulting to `/`. For example, if the `url` is\n  `http://localhost/users`, a transport connection will be established to\n  `http://localhost` and a Socket.IO connection will be established to\n  `/users`.\n\n### IO#protocol\n\n  Socket.io protocol revision number this client works with.\n\n### IO#Socket\n\n  Reference to the `Socket` constructor.\n\n### IO#Manager\n\n  Reference to the `Manager` constructor.\n\n### IO#Emitter\n\n  Reference to the `Emitter` constructor.\n\n### Manager(url:String, opts:Object)\n\n  A `Manager` represents a connection to a given Socket.IO server. One or\n  more `Socket` instances are associated with the manager. The manager\n  can be accessed through the `io` property of each `Socket` instance.\n\n  The `opts` are also passed to `engine.io` upon initialization of the\n  underlying `Socket`.\n\n  Options:\n  - `reconnection` whether to reconnect automatically (`true`)\n  - `reconnectionDelay` how long to wait before attempting a new\n    reconnection (`1000`)\n  - `reconnectionDelayMax` maximum amount of time to wait between\n    reconnections (`5000`). Each attempt increases the reconnection by\n    the amount specified by `reconnectionDelay`.\n  - `timeout` connection timeout before a `connect_error`\n    and `connect_timeout` events are emitted (`20000`)\n  - `autoConnect` by setting this false, you have to call `manager.open`\n    whenever you decide it's appropriate\n\n#### Events\n\n  - `connect`. Fired upon a successful connection.\n  - `connect_error`. Fired upon a connection error.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Object` error object\n  - `connect_timeout`. Fired upon a connection timeout.\n  - `reconnect`. Fired upon a successful reconnection.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Number` reconnection attempt number\n  - `reconnect_attempt`. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.\n  - `reconnecting`. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Number` reconnection attempt number\n  - `reconnect_error`. Fired upon a reconnection attempt error.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Object` error object\n  - `reconnect_failed`. Fired when couldn't reconnect within `reconnectionAttempts`\n\nThe events above are also emitted on the individual sockets that\nreconnect that depend on this `Manager`.\n\n### Manager#reconnection(v:Boolean):Manager\n\n  Sets the `reconnection` option, or returns it if no parameters\n  are passed.\n\n### Manager#reconnectionAttempts(v:Boolean):Manager\n\n  Sets the `reconnectionAttempts` option, or returns it if no parameters\n  are passed.\n\n### Manager#reconnectionDelay(v:Boolean):Manager\n\n  Sets the `reconectionDelay` option, or returns it if no parameters\n  are passed.\n\n### Manager#reconnectionDelayMax(v:Boolean):Manager\n\n  Sets the `reconectionDelayMax` option, or returns it if no parameters\n  are passed.\n\n### Manager#timeout(v:Boolean):Manager\n\n  Sets the `timeout` option, or returns it if no parameters\n  are passed.\n\n### Socket\n\n#### Events\n\n  - `connect`. Fired upon connecting.\n  - `error`. Fired upon a connection error\n    Parameters:\n      - `Object` error data\n  - `disconnect`. Fired upon a disconnection.\n  - `reconnect`. Fired upon a successful reconnection.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Number` reconnection attempt number\n  - `reconnect_attempt`. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.\n  - `reconnecting`. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Number` reconnection attempt number\n  - `reconnect_error`. Fired upon a reconnection attempt error.\n    Parameters:\n      - `Object` error object\n  - `reconnect_failed`. Fired when couldn't reconnect within `reconnectionAttempts`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"}],"repository":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client.git","repo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Automattic/socket.io-client/master/README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client","licurl":true,"dupl":["LearnBoost","socket.io-client"]},{"name":"escape-html","label":"escape-html@1.0.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/component/escape-html/master/Readme.md","text":"\n# escape-html\n\n  Escape HTML entities\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar escape = require('escape-html');\nescape(str);\n```\n\n## License\n\n  MIT"}],"repository":"https://github.com/component/escape-html.git","repo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/component/escape-html/master/Readme.md","homepage":"https://github.com/component/escape-html","licurl":true,"dupl":["component","escape-html"]},{"name":"ms","label":"ms@0.6.2","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guille/ms.js/master/LICENSE","text":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Guillermo Rauch <rauchg@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
