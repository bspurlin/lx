ANSI escape codes are used to do\nfancy things in a terminal window, like render text in colors, delete characters,\nlines, the entire window, or hide and show the cursor, and lots more!\n\nThe code for the example in the screenshot above can be found in the\n`examples/imgcat` directory.\n\n#### Features:\n\n * 256 color support for the terminal!\n * Make a beep sound from your terminal!\n * Works with *any* writable `Stream` instance.\n * Allows you to move the cursor anywhere on the terminal window.\n * Allows you to delete existing contents from the terminal window.\n * Allows you to hide and show the cursor.\n * Converts CSS color codes and RGB values into ANSI escape codes.\n * Low-level; you are in control of when escape codes are used, it's not abstracted.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install ansi\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n``` js\nvar ansi = require('ansi')\n  , cursor = ansi(process.stdout)\n\n// You can chain your calls forever:\ncursor\n  .red()                 // Set font color to red\n  .bg.grey()             // Set background color to grey\n  .write('Hello World!') // Write 'Hello World!' to stdout\n  .bg.reset()            // Reset the bgcolor before writing the trailing \\n,\n                         //      to avoid Terminal glitches\n  .write('\\n')           // And a final \\n to wrap things up\n\n// Rendering modes are persistent:\ncursor.hex('#660000').bold().underline()\n\n// You can use the regular logging functions, text will be green\nconsole.log('This is blood red, bold text')\n\n// To reset just the foreground color:\ncursor.fg.reset()\n\nconsole.log('This will still be bold')\n\n// Clean up after yourself!\ncursor.reset()\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich <nathan@tootallnate.net>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n----------\n\nAdditionally:\n\n * The `yoshi.png` file inside `examples/imgcat` is copyright to Nintendo, Inc.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/TooTallNate/ansi.js.git","homepage":"https://github.com/TooTallNate/ansi.js"},{"name":"archiver","label":"archiver@0.10.1","version":"0.10.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/connect-phonegap/node_modules/archiver/LICENSE-MIT","notice":"Copyright (c) 2012-2014 Chris Talkington, contributors.","text":"Copyright (c) 2012-2014 Chris Talkington, contributors.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, 'options');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, 'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you want to have specific paths returned, specify a `modules` property in the options object.\n\n``` js\nvar shims = {\n    http: '/your/path/to/http.js'\n};\n\nvar resolve = require('browser-resolve');\nresolve('fs', { modules: shims }, function(err, path) {\n    console.log(path);\n});\n```\n\n```\n$ node example/builtin.js\n/home/substack/projects/node-browser-resolve/builtin/fs.js\n```\n\n## browser field\nbrowser-specific versions of modules\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"name\": \"custom\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"./main.js\": \"custom.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\nvar resolve = require('browser-resolve');\nvar parent = { filename: __dirname + '/custom/file.js' };\nresolve('./main.js', parent, function(err, path) {\n    console.log(path);\n});\n```\n\n```\n$ node example/custom.js\n/home/substack/projects/node-browser-resolve/example/custom/custom.js\n```\n\n## skip\n\nYou can skip over dependencies by setting a\n[browser field](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901)\nvalue to `false`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"skip\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"tar\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is handy if you have code like:\n\n``` js\nvar tar = require('tar');\n\nexports.add = function (a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n};\n\nexports.parse = function () {\n    return tar.Parse();\n};\n```\n\nso that `require('tar')` will just return `{}` in the browser because you don't\nintend to support the `.parse()` export in a browser environment.\n\n``` js\nvar resolve = require('browser-resolve');\nvar parent = { filename: __dirname + '/skip/main.js' };\nresolve('tar', parent, function(err, path) {\n    console.log(path);\n});\n```\n\n```\n$ node example/skip.js\n/home/substack/projects/node-browser-resolve/empty.js\n```\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n\n# upgrade notes\n\nPrior to v1.x this library provided shims for node core modules. These have since been removed. If you want to have alternative core modules provided, use the `modules` option when calling resolve.\n\nThis was done to allow package managers to choose which shims they want to use without browser-resolve being the central point of update.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/shtylman/node-browser-resolve.git","homepage":"https://github.com/shtylman/node-browser-resolve"},{"name":"browserify","label":"browserify@3.46.0","version":"3.46.0","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/cordova-js/node_modules/browserify/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors.","text":"Some pieces from builtins/ taken from node core under this license:\n\n----\n\nCopyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('commander');\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')\n  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')\n  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')\n  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('you ordered a pizza with:');\nif (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');\nif (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineappe');\nif (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');\nconsole.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);\n```\n\n Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as \"--template-engine\" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.\n\n## Automated --help\n\n The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:\n\n```  \n $ ./examples/pizza --help\n\n   Usage: pizza [options]\n\n   Options:\n\n     -V, --version        output the version number\n     -p, --peppers        Add peppers\n     -P, --pineapple      Add pineappe\n     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce\n     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\n     -h, --help           output usage information\n\n```\n\n## Coercion\n\n```js\nfunction range(val) {\n  return val.split('..').map(Number);\n}\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',');\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .usage('[options] <file ...>')\n  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)\n  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)\n  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)\n  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)\n  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(' int: %j', program.integer);\nconsole.log(' float: %j', program.float);\nconsole.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);\nprogram.range = program.range || [];\nconsole.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);\nconsole.log(' list: %j', program.list);\nconsole.log(' args: %j', program.args);\n```\n\n## Custom help\n\n You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information\n by listening for \"--help\". Commander will automatically\n exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program\n does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example\n in the following executable \"stuff\" will not output when\n `--help` is used.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('../');\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',').map(Number);\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')\n  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')\n  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');\n\n// must be before .parse() since\n// node's emit() is immediate\n\nprogram.on('--help', function(){\n  console.log('  Examples:');\n  console.log('');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');\n  console.log('');\n});\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('stuff');\n```\n\nyielding the following help output:\n\n```\n\nUsage: custom-help [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -V, --version  output the version number\n  -f, --foo      enable some foo\n  -b, --bar      enable some bar\n  -B, --baz      enable some baz\n\nExamples:\n\n  $ custom-help --help\n  $ custom-help -h\n\n```\n\n## .prompt(msg, fn)\n\n Single-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('name: ', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Multi-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('description:', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Coercion:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Age: ', Number, function(age){\n  console.log('age: %j', age);\n});\n```\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Birthdate: ', Date, function(date){\n  console.log('date: %s', date);\n});\n```\n\n## .password(msg[, mask], fn)\n\nPrompt for password without echoing:\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nPrompt for password with mask char \"*\":\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', '*', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\n## .confirm(msg, fn)\n\n Confirm with the given `msg`:\n\n```js\nprogram.confirm('continue?

'Worker' : 'Master');\n    console.error(prefix, x);\n  };\n} else {\n  debug = function() { };\n}\n```\n\n This concept is extremely simple but it works well. With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.\n \nExample _app.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n\n// fake app\n\ndebug('booting %s', name);\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n\n// fake worker of some kind\n\nrequire('./worker');\n```\n\nExample _worker.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('worker');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Millisecond diff\n\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n\n  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n  \n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Conventions\n\n If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\". \n\n## Wildcards\n\n  The \"*\" character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.  For example, `DEBUG=* -connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with \"connect:\".\n\n## Browser support\n\n Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`. \n\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."}]},{"name":"debug","label":"debug@0.8.1","version":"0.8.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/connect-phonegap/node_modules/connect/node_modules/debug/Readme.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>","text":"# debug\n\n  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install debug\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine.

Written in [CoffeeScript](coffeescript.org) by the author of [CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development](http://pragprog.com/book/tbcoffee/coffeescript).\n\n## What's it for?\n\nSay you have a set of resources that depend on each other in some way. These resources can be anything—files, chains of command, plot twists on *Lost*—whatever. All that matters is that each one has a unique string identifier, and a list of direct dependencies.\n\n`dep-graph` makes it easy to compute \"chains\" of dependencies, with guaranteed logical ordering and no duplicates. That's trivial in most cases, but if `A` depends on `B` and `B` depends on `A`, a naïve dependency graph would get trapped in an infinite loop. `dep-graph` throws an error if any such \"cycles\" are detected.\n\n## How to use it?\n\n### In the browser\n\n    deps = new DepGraph\n    deps.add 'A', 'B'  # A requires B\n    deps.add 'B', 'C'  # B requires C\n    deps.getChain 'A'  # ['C', 'B', 'A']\n\n### In Node.js\n\nSame as above, but first run\n\n    npm install dep-graph\n\nfrom your project's directory, and put\n\n    DepGraph = require 'dep-graph'\n\nat the top of your file.\n\n## License\n\n©2011 Trevor Burnham and available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php):\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Connections are established even in the presence of:\n  - proxies and load balancers.\n  - personal firewall and antivirus software.\n  - for more information refer to **Goals** and **Architecture** sections\n- **Minimal client size** aided by:\n  - lazy loading of flash transports.\n  - lack of redundant transports.\n- **Scalable**\n  - load balancer friendly\n- **Future proof**\n- **100% Node.JS core style**\n  - No API sugar (left for higher level projects)\n  - Written in readable vanilla JavaScript\n\n## API\n\n### Server\n\n<hr><br>\n\n#### Top-level\n\nThese are exposed by `require('engine.io')`:\n\n##### Events\n\n- `flush`\n    - Called when a socket buffer is being flushed.\n    - **Arguments**\n      - `Socket`: socket being flushed\n      - `Array`: write buffer\n- `drain`\n    - Called when a socket buffer is drained\n    - **Arguments**\n      - `Socket`: socket being flushed\n\n##### Properties\n\n- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number\n- `Server`: Server class constructor\n- `Socket`: Socket class constructor\n- `Transport` _(Function)_: transport constructor\n- `transports` _(Object)_: map of available transports\n\n##### Methods\n\n- `()`\n    - Returns a new `Server` instance. If the first argument is an `http.Server` then the\n      new `Server` instance will be attached to it. Otherwise, the arguments are passed\n      directly to the `Server` constructor.\n    - **Parameters**\n      - `http.Server`: optional, server to attach to.\n      - `Object`: optional, options object (see `Server#constructor` api docs below)\n\n  The following are identical ways to instantiate a server and then attach it.\n  ```js\n  var httpServer; // previously created with `http.createServer();` from node.js api.\n\n  // create a server first, and then attach\n  var eioServer = require('engine.io').Server();\n  eioServer.attach(httpServer);\n\n  // or call the module as a function to get `Server`\n  var eioServer = require('engine.io')();\n  eioServer.attach(httpServer);\n\n  // immediately attach\n  var eioServer = require('engine.io')(http_server);\n  ```\n\n- `listen`\n    - Creates an `http.Server` which listens on the given port and attaches WS\n      to it.

It runs the server tests that are aided by\nthe usage of `engine.io-client`.\n\nMake sure `npm install` is run first.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe main goal of `Engine` is ensuring the most reliable realtime communication.\nUnlike the previous Socket.IO core, it always establishes a long-polling\nconnection first, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are \"tested\" on\nthe side.\n\nDuring the lifetime of the Socket.IO projects, we've found countless drawbacks\nto relying on `HTML5 WebSocket` or `Flash Socket` as the first connection\nmechanisms.\n\nBoth are clearly the _right way_ of establishing a bidirectional communication,\nwith HTML5 WebSocket being the way of the future. However, to answer most business\nneeds, alternative traditional HTTP 1.1 mechanisms are just as good as delivering\nthe same solution.\n\nWebSocket based connections have two fundamental benefits:\n\n1. **Better server performance**\n\n  - _A: Load balancers_<br>\n      Load balancing a long polling connection poses a serious architectural nightmare\n      since requests can come from any number of open sockets by the user agent, but\n      they all need to be routed to the process and computer that owns the `Engine`\n      connection. This negatively impacts RAM and CPU usage.\n  - _B: Network traffic_<br>\n      WebSocket is designed around the premise that each message frame has to be \n      surrounded by the least amount of data. In HTTP 1.1 transports, each message\n      frame is surrounded by HTTP headers and chunked encoding frames. If you try to\n      send the message _\"Hello world\"_ with xhr-polling, the message ultimately\n      becomes larger than if you were to send it with WebSocket.\n  - _C: Lightweight parser_<br>\n      As an effect of **B**, the server has to do a lot more work to parse the network\n      data and figure out the message when traditional HTTP requests are used\n      (as in long polling). This means that another advantage of WebSocket is\n      less server CPU usage.\n\n2. **Better user experience**\n\n    Due to the reasons stated in point **1**, the most important effect of being able\n    to establish a WebSocket connection is raw data transfer speed, which translates\n    in _some_ cases in better user experience.\n\n    Applications with heavy realtime interaction (such as games) will benefit greatly,\n    whereas applications like realtime chat (Gmail/Facebook), newsfeeds (Facebook) or\n    timelines (Twitter) will have negligible user experience improvements.\n\nHaving said this, attempting to establish a WebSocket connection directly so far has\nproven problematic:\n\n1. **Proxies**<br>\n    Many corporate proxies block WebSocket traffic.\n\n2. **Personal firewall and antivirus software**<br>\n    As a result of our research, we've found that at least 3 personal security\n    applications block WebSocket traffic.\n\n3. **Cloud application platforms**<br>\n    Platforms like Heroku or No.de have had trouble keeping up with the fast-paced\n    nature of the evolution of the WebSocket protocol. Applications therefore end up\n    inevitably using long polling, but the seamless installation experience of \n    Socket.IO we strive for (_\"require() it and it just works\"_) disappears.\n\nSome of these problems have solutions. In the case of proxies and personal programs,\nhowever, the solutions many times involve upgrading software. Experience has shown\nthat relying on client software upgrades to deliver a business solution is\nfruitless: the very existence of this project has to do with a fragmented panorama\nof user agent distribution, with clients connecting with latest versions of the most\nmodern user agents (Chrome, Firefox and Safari), but others with versions as low as\nIE 5.5.\n\nFrom the user perspective, an unsuccessful WebSocket connection can translate in\nup to at least 10 seconds of waiting for the realtime application to begin\nexchanging data. This **perceptively** hurts user experience.\n\nTo summarize, **Engine** focuses on reliability and user experience first, marginal\npotential UX improvements and increased server performance second. `Engine` is the\nresult of all the lessons learned with WebSocket in the wild.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe main premise of `Engine`, and the core of its existence, is the ability to\nswap transports on the fly. A connection starts as xhr-polling, but it can\nswitch to WebSocket.\n\nThe central problem this poses is: how do we switch transports without losing\nmessages?\n\n`Engine` only switches from polling to another transport in between polling\ncycles. Since the server closes the connection after a certain timeout when\nthere's no activity, and the polling transport implementation buffers messages\nin between connections, this ensures no message loss and optimal performance.\n\nAnother benefit of this design is that we workaround almost all the limitations\nof **Flash Socket**, such as slow connection times, increased file size (we can\nsafely lazy load it without hurting user experience), etc.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can I use engine without Socket.IO ?\n\nAbsolutely. Although the recommended framework for building realtime applications\nis Socket.IO, since it provides fundamental features for real-world applications \nsuch as multiplexing, reconnection support, etc.\n\n`Engine` is to Socket.IO what Connect is to Express. An essential piece for building\nrealtime frameworks, but something you _probably_ won't be using for building\nactual applications.\n\n### Does the server serve the client?\n\nNo. The main reason is that `Engine` is meant to be bundled with frameworks.\nSocket.IO includes `Engine`, therefore serving two clients is not necessary. If\nyou use Socket.IO, including\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\">\n```\n\nhas you covered.\n\n### Can I implement `Engine` in other languages?\n\nAbsolutely. The [engine.io-protocol](https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol)\nrepository contains the most up to date description of the specification\nat all times, and the parser implementation in JavaScript.\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Guillermo Rauch <guillermo@learnboost.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n"}],"repository":"git@github.com:LearnBoost/engine.io.git","homepage":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io"},{"name":"engine.io-client","label":"engine.io-client@1.3.1","version":"1.3.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/connect-phonegap/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/socket.io-client/node_modules/engine.io-client/README.md","notice":"Copyright (c) 2014 Automattic, Inc.","text":"\n# Engine.IO client\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io-client.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io-client)\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io-client.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io-client)\n\nThis is the client for [Engine.IO](http://github.com/automattic/engine.io),\nthe implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device\nbi-directional communication layer for [Socket.IO](http://github.com/automattic/socket.io).\n\n## How to use\n\n### Standalone\n\nYou can find an `engine.io.js` file in this repository, which is a\nstandalone build you can use as follows:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/engine.io.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  // eio = Socket\n  var socket = eio('ws://localhost');\n  socket.on('open', function(){\n    socket.on('message', function(data){});\n    socket.on('close', function(){});\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n### With browserify\n\nEngine.IO is a commonjs module, which means you can include it by using\n`require` on the browser and package using [browserify](http://browserify.org/):\n\n1. install the client package\n\n    ```bash\n    $ npm install engine.io-client\n    ```\n\n1. write your app code\n\n    ```js\n    var socket = require('engine.io-client')('ws://localhost');\n    socket.on('open', function(){\n      socket.on('message', function(data){});\n      socket.on('close', function(){});\n    });\n    ```\n\n1. build your app bundle\n\n    ```bash\n    $ browserify app.js > bundle.js\n    ```\n\n1. include on your page\n\n    ```html\n    <script src=\"/path/to/bundle.js\"></script>\n    ```\n\n### Sending and receiving binary\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/engine.io.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  var socket = new eio.Socket('ws://localhost/');\n  socket.binaryType = 'blob';\n  socket.on('open', function () {\n    socket.send(new Int8Array(5));\n    socket.on('message', function(blob){});\n    socket.on('close', function(){ });\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n### Node.JS\n\nAdd `engine.io-client` to your `package.json` and then:\n\n```js\nvar socket = require('engine.io-client')('ws://localhost');\nsocket.on('open', function(){\n  socket.on('message', function(data){});\n  socket.on('close', function(){});\n});\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- Lightweight\n- Runs on browser and node.js seamlessly\n- Transports are independent of `Engine`\n  - Easy to debug\n  - Easy to unit test\n- Runs inside HTML5 WebWorker\n- Can send and receive binary data\n  - Receives as ArrayBuffer or Blob when in browser, and Buffer or ArrayBuffer\n    in Node\n  - When XHR2 or WebSockets are used, binary is emitted directly. Otherwise\n    binary is encoded into base64 strings, and decoded when binary types are\n    supported.\n  - With browsers that don't support ArrayBuffer, an object { base64: true,\n    data: dataAsBase64String } is emitted on the `message` event.\n\n## API\n\n### Socket\n\nThe client class. Mixes in [Emitter](http://github.com/component/emitter).\nExposed as `eio` in the browser standalone build.\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number\n- `binaryType` _(String)_ : can be set to 'arraybuffer' or 'blob' in browsers,\n  and `buffer` or `arraybuffer` in Node. Blob is only used in browser if it's\n  supported.\n\n#### Events\n\n- `open`\n  - Fired upon successful connection.\n- `message`\n  - Fired when data is received from the server.\n  - **Arguments**\n    - `String` | `ArrayBuffer`: utf-8 encoded data or ArrayBuffer containing\n      binary data\n- `close`\n  - Fired upon disconnection. In compliance with the WebSocket API spec, this event may be \n    fired even if the `open` event does not occur (i.e. due to connection error or `close()`).\n- `error`\n  - Fired when an error occurs.\n- `flush`\n  - Fired upon completing a buffer flush\n- `drain`\n  - Fired after `drain` event of transport if writeBuffer is empty\n- `upgradeError`\n  - Fired if an error occurs with a transport we're trying to upgrade to.\n- `upgrade`\n  - Fired upon upgrade success, after the new transport is set\n\n#### Methods\n\n- **constructor**\n    - Initializes the client\n    - **Parameters**\n      - `String` uri\n      - `Object`: optional, options object\n    - **Options**\n      - `agent` (`http.Agent`): `http.Agent` to use, defaults to `false` (NodeJS only)\n      - `upgrade` (`Boolean`): defaults to true, whether the client should try\n      to upgrade the transport from long-polling to something better.\n      - `forceJSONP` (`Boolean`): forces JSONP for polling transport.\n      - `forceBase64` (`Boolean`): forces base 64 encoding for polling transport even when XHR2 responseType is available and WebSocket even if the used standard supports binary.\n      - `timestampRequests` (`Boolean`): whether to add the timestamp with\n        each transport request. Note: this is ignored if the browser is\n        IE or Android, in which case requests are always stamped (`false`)\n      - `timestampParam` (`String`): timestamp parameter (`t`)\n      - `policyPort` (`Number`): port the policy server listens on (`843`)\n      - `path` (`String`): path to connect to, default is `/engine.io`\n      - `transports` (`Array`): a list of transports to try (in order).\n      Defaults to `['polling', 'websocket']`. `Engine`\n      always attempts to connect directly with the first one, provided the\n      feature detection test for it passes.\n      - `rememberUpgrade` (`Boolean`): defaults to false.\n        If true and if the previous websocket connection to the server succeeded,\n        the connection attempt will bypass the normal upgrade process and will initially\n        try websocket. A connection attempt following a transport error will use the \n        normal upgrade process. It is recommended you turn this on only when using\n        SSL/TLS connections, or if you know that your network does not block websockets.\n- `send`\n    - Sends a message to the server\n    - **Parameters**\n      - `String` | `ArrayBuffer` | `ArrayBufferView` | `Blob`: data to send\n      - `Function`: optional, callback upon `drain`\n- `close`\n    - Disconnects the client.\n\n### Transport\n\nThe transport class. Private. _Inherits from EventEmitter_.\n\n#### Events\n\n- `poll`: emitted by polling transports upon starting a new request\n- `pollComplete`: emitted by polling transports upon completing a request\n- `drain`: emitted by polling transports upon a buffer drain\n\n## Tests\n\n`engine.io-client` is used to test\n[engine](http://github.com/automattic/engine.io). Running the `engine.io`\ntest suite ensures the client works and vice-versa.\n\nBrowser tests are run using [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul). You can\nrun the tests locally using the following command.\n\n```\n./node_modules/.bin/zuul --local 8080 -- test/index.js\n```\n\nAdditionally, `engine.io-client` has a standalone test suite you can run\nwith `make test` which will run node.js and browser tests. You must have zuul setup with\na saucelabs account.\n\n## Support\n\nThe support channels for `engine.io-client` are the same as `socket.io`:\n  - irc.freenode.net **#socket.io**\n  - [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/socket_io)\n  - [Website](http://socket.io)\n\n## Development\n\nTo contribute patches, run tests or benchmarks, make sure to clone the\nrepository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/automattic/engine.io-client.git\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\ncd engine.io-client\nnpm install\n```\n\nSee the `Tests` section above for how to run tests before submitting any patches.\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Copyright (c) 2014 Automattic, Inc.\n\n"}],"repository":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-client.git","homepage":"http://socket.io"},{"name":"engine.io-parser","label":"engine.io-parser@1.0.6","version":"1.0.6","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/connect-phonegap/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/engine.io-parser/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright (c) 2014 Automattic <dev@cloudup.com>","text":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Automattic <dev@cloudup.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE."}],"repository":"git@github.com:LearnBoost/engine.io-parser.git","homepage":"https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol"},{"name":"escodegen","label":"escodegen@1.1.0","version":"1.1.0","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/cordova-js/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/module-deps/node_modules/detective/node_modules/escodegen/LICENSE.BSD","notice":"COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"","text":"Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

No need to mess with DNS or deploy just to have others test out your changes.\n\nGreat for working with browser testing tools like browserling or external api callback services like twilio which require a public url for callbacks.\n\n## installation ##\n\n```\nnpm install -g localtunnel\n```\n\nThis will install the localtunnel module globally and add the 'lt' client cli tool to your PATH.\n\n## use ##\n\nAssuming your local server is running on port 8000, just use the ```lt``` command to start the tunnel.\n\n```\nlt --port 8000\n```\n\nThats it! It will connect to the tunnel server, setup the tunnel, and tell you what url to use for your testing. This url will remain active for the duration of your session; so feel free to share it with others for happy fun time!\n\nYou can restart your local server all you want, ```lt``` is smart enough to detect this and reconnect once it is back.\n\n### arguments\n\nBelow are some common arguments. See `lt --help` for additional arguments\n\n* `--subdomain` request a named subdomain on the localtunnel server (default is random characters)\n* `--local-host` proxy to a hostname other than localhost\n\n## API ##\n\nThe localtunnel client is also usable through an API (for test integration, automation, etc)\n\n### localtunnel(port [,opts], fn)\n\nCreates a new localtunnel to the specified local `port`. `fn` will be called once you have been assigned a public localtunnel url. `opts` can be used to request a specific `subdomain`.\n\n```javascript\nvar localtunnel = require('localtunnel');\n\nlocaltunnel(port, function(err, tunnel) {\n    if (err) ...\n\n    // the assigned public url for your tunnel\n    // i.e. https://abcdefgjhij.localtunnel.me\n    tunnel.url;\n});\n```\n\n### opts\n\n* `subdomain` A *string* value requesting a specific subdomain on the proxy server. **Note** You may not actually receive this name depending on availablily.\n* `local_host` Proxy to this hostname instead of `localhost`. This will also cause the `Host` header to be re-written to this value in proxied requests.\n\n### Tunnel\n\nThe `tunnel` instance returned to your callback emits the following events\n\n|event|args|description|\n|----|----|----|\n|error|err|fires when an error happens on the tunnel|\n|close||fires when the tunnel has closed|\n\nThe `tunnel instance has the following methods\n\n|method|args|description|\n|----|----|----|\n|close||close the tunnel|\n\n## other clients ##\n\nClients in other languages\n\n*go* [gotunnelme](https://github.com/NoahShen/gotunnelme)\n\n## server ##\n\nSee defunctzombie/localtunnel-server for details on the server that powers localtunnel.\n\n## License ##\nMIT\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/shtylman/localtunnel.git","homepage":"https://github.com/shtylman/localtunnel"},{"name":"lockfile","label":"lockfile@0.4.0","version":"0.4.0","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/lockfile/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright (c) Isaac Z.

Properties files store key-value pairs.  They are typically used for configuration and internationalization in Java applications as well as in Actionscript projects.  Here's an example of the format:\n\n\t# You are reading the \".properties\" entry.\n\t! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.\n\twebsite = http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\tlanguage = English\n\t# The backslash below tells the application to continue reading\n\t# the value onto the next line.\n\tmessage = Welcome to \\\n\t          Wikipedia!\n\t# Add spaces to the key\n\tkey\\ with\\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key \"key with spaces\".\n\t# Unicode\n\ttab : \\u0009\n*(taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties#Format))*\n\nCurrently works with any version of node.js.\n\n## The API\n\n- `parse(text)`: Parses `text` into key-value pairs.  Returns an object containing the key-value pairs.\n- `read(path[, callback])`: Opens the file specified by `path` and calls `parse` on its content.  If the optional `callback` parameter is provided, the result is then passed to it as the second parameter.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter. If `callback` is not provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and calls `parse` on its contents.  The resulting object is immediately returned.\n- `createEditor([path[, callback]])`:  If neither `path` or `callback` are provided an empty editor object is returned synchronously.  If only `path` is provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and parsed.  An editor object with the results in then immediately returned.  If both `path` and `callback` are provided, the file specified by `path` is read and parsed asynchronously.  An editor object with the results are then passed to `callback` as the second parameters.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter.\n- `Editor`: The editor object is returned by `createEditor`.  Has the following API:\n\t- `get(key)`: Returns the value currently associated with `key`.\n\t- `set(key, [value[, comment]])`: Associates `key` with `value`. An optional comment can be provided. If `value` is not specified or is `null`, then `key` is unset.\n\t- `unset(key)`: Unsets the specified `key`.\n\t- `save([path][, callback]])`: Writes the current contents of this editor object to a file specified by `path`.  If `path` is not provided, then it'll be defaulted to the `path` value passed to `createEditor`.  The `callback` parameter is called when the file has been written to disk.\n\t- `addHeadComment`: Added a comment to the head of the file.\n\t- `toString`: Returns the string representation of this properties editor object.  This string will be written to a file if `save` is called.\n\n## Getting node-properties-parser\n\nThe easiest way to get node-properties-parser is with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n\tnpm install properties-parser\n\nAlternatively you can clone this git repository:\n\n\tgit://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser.git\n\n## Developed by\n* Xavi Ramirez\n\n## License\nThis project is released under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)."}],"repository":"https://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser","homepage":"https://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser","license":"MIT"},{"name":"proto-list","label":"proto-list@1.2.2","version":"1.2.2","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/npmconf/node_modules/config-chain/node_modules/proto-list/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright 2009, 2010, 2011 Isaac Z.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n"},{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/cordova-js/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/punycode/LICENSE-MIT.txt","notice":"Copyright Mathias Bynens <http://mathiasbynens.be/>","text":"Copyright Mathias Bynens <http://mathiasbynens.be/>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Aliased as `.from(dir)`.\n\n### .index(path)\n\n  By default send supports \"index.html\" files, to disable this\n  invoke `.index(false)` or to supply a new index pass a string.\n\n### .maxage(ms)\n\n  Provide a max-age in milliseconds for http caching, defaults to 0.\n\n### .hidden(bool)\n\n  Enable or disable transfer of hidden files, defaults to false.\n\n## Error-handling\n\n  By default when no `error` listeners are present an automatic response will be made, otherwise you have full control over the response, aka you may show a 5xx page etc.\n\n## Caching\n\n  It does _not_ perform internal caching, you should use a reverse proxy cache such\n  as Varnish for this, or those fancy things called CDNs. If your application is small enough that it would benefit from single-node memory caching, it's small enough that it does not need caching at all ;).\n\n## Debugging\n\n To enable `debug()` instrumentation output export __DEBUG__:\n\n```\n$ DEBUG=send node app\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\n```\n$ npm install\n$ make test\n```\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/visionmedia/send.git","homepage":"https://github.com/visionmedia/send"},{"name":"sha","label":"sha@1.0.1","version":"1.0.1","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForbesLindesay/sha/master/LICENSE","text":"Copyright (c) 2013 Forbes Lindesay\n\nThe BSD License\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\nare met:\n\n1.

For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                       --source-map.                                      [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input fles are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort=true` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    // if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n"}],"repository":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs"},{"name":"uglify-to-browserify","label":"uglify-to-browserify@1.0.2","version":"1.0.2","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/cordova-js/node_modules/uglify-js/node_modules/uglify-to-browserify/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright (c) 2013 Forbes Lindesay","text":"Copyright (c) 2013 Forbes Lindesay\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n"},{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/connect-phonegap/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/engine.io-parser/node_modules/utf8/LICENSE-MIT.txt","notice":"Copyright Mathias Bynens <http://mathiasbynens.be/>","text":"Copyright Mathias Bynens <http://mathiasbynens.be/>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

See http://einaros.github.com/ws for the full reports.\n\nComes with a command line utility, `wscat`, which can either act as a server (--listen), or client (--connect); Use it to debug simple websocket services.\n\n## Protocol support ##\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera. Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`, or argument `-p 8` for wscat)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`, or argument `-p 13` for wscat)\n\n_See the echo.websocket.org example below for how to use the `protocolVersion` option._\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### Installing ###\n\n`npm install ws`\n\n### Sending and receiving text data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\nws.on('open', function() {\n    ws.send('something');\n});\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n    // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received\n    // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\nws.on('open', function() {\n    var array = new Float32Array(5);\n    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) array[i] = i / 2;\n    ws.send(array, {binary: true, mask: true});\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be masked according to the websocket protocol. The same option applies for text data.\n\n### Server example ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\nwss.on('connection', function(ws) {\n    ws.on('message', function(message) {\n        console.log('received: %s', message);\n    });\n    ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\n  \nwss.broadcast = function(data) {\n\tfor(var i in this.clients)\n\t\tthis.clients[i].send(data);\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices ###\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional callback.\n// The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function(error) {\n    // if error is null, the send has been completed,\n    // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note**\n// that since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not*\n// be captured when this technique is used.\ntry {\n    ws.send('something');\n}\ncatch (e) {\n    // handle error\n}\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {protocolVersion: 8, origin: 'http://websocket.org'});\nws.on('open', function() {\n    console.log('connected');\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\nws.on('close', function() {\n    console.log('disconnected');\n});\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n    console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n    }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### wscat against echo.websocket.org ###\n\n    $ npm install -g ws\n    $ wscat -c ws://echo.websocket.org -p 8\n    connected (press CTRL+C to quit)\n    > hi there\n    < hi there\n    > are you a happy parrot?\n    < are you a happy parrot?\n\n### Other examples ###\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the examples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express 2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests ###\n\n`make test`\n\n## API Docs ##\n\nSee the doc/ directory for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## License ##\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik <einaros@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"}],"repository":"git://github.com/einaros/ws.git","homepage":"https://github.com/einaros/ws"},{"name":"xcode","label":"xcode@0.6.6","version":"0.6.6","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"/home/pedwards/Documents/lx/node_modules/LXWebGui/test/input_folder/node_modules/phonegap/node_modules/cordova-lib/node_modules/xcode/LICENSE","notice":"Copyright 2012 Andrew Lunny, Adobe Systems","text":"   Copyright 2012 Andrew Lunny, Adobe Systems\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n\n"}],"repository":"https://github.com/alunny/node-xcode.git","homepage":"https://github.com/alunny/node-xcode"},{"name":"xmlbuilder","label":"xmlbuilder@0.4.3","version":"0.4.3","licensefile":[{"licensepath":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/master/LICENSE","text":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Ozgur Ozcitak\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
